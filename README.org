☯ About
Emacs changes how you *think* about programming.

Emacs is *totally introspectable*. You can always find out 'what code runs when I press this button?'.

Emacs is an *incremental programming environment*. There's no edit-compile-run cycle. There isn't even an edit-run cycle. You can execute snippets of code and gradually turn them into a finished project. There's no distinction between your editor and your interpreter.

Emacs is a *mutable environment*. You can set variables, tweak functions with advice, or redefine entire functions. Nothing is off-limits.

Emacs provides *functionality without applications*. Rather than separate applications, functionality is all integrated into your Emacs instance. Amazingly, this works. Ever wanted to use the same snippet tool for writing C++ classes as well as emails?

Emacs is full of *incredible software concepts that haven't hit the mainstream yet*. For example:

-   Many platforms have a single item clipboard. Emacs has an *infinite clipboard*.
-   If you undo a change, and then continue editing, you can't redo the original change. Emacs allows *undoing to any historical state*, even allowing tree-based exploration of history.
-   Emacs supports a *reverse variable search*: you can find variables with a given value.
-   You can perform *structural editing* of code, allowing you to make changes without breaking syntax. This works for lisps (paredit) and non-lisps (smartparens).
-   Many applications use a modal GUI: for example, you can't do other edits during a find-and-replace operation. Emacs provides *recursive editing* that allow you to suspend what you're currently doing, perform other edits, then continue the original task.

Emacs has a *documentation culture*. Emacs includes a usage manual, a lisp programming manual, pervasive docstrings and even an interactive tutorial.

Emacs has a *broad ecosystem*. If you want to edit code in a niche language, there's probably an Emacs package for it.

Emacs doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas, and there are other great tools out there. Nonetheless, we believe the [[https://i.stack.imgur.com/7Cu9Z.jpg][Emacs learning curve]] pays off.

Welcome to the /Emacs Of Dreams/. Wait no, I meant the *Emacs Operating System*

This repository contains my personal configuration for =GNU Emacs= that I use on
the daily and port around from system to system with me.

The configuration depends on [[file:init.el][init.el]]  and [[file:early-init.el][early-init.el]] (sets up a few initial GUI settings), bootstraps [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]. and loads [[file:init.el][init.el]], which is where the majority of the configuration magic happens.

This configuration uses default-style keybindings and known to work with GNU
Emacs 27.1 and later.

☯ Installation
[[https://GitHub.com/Likhon-baRoy/][http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/built-with-swag.svg]]

1. Install [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].
2. Delete =~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d=, if you already have it.
3. Clone this repo to =HOME= or =~/= path using git and update all the submodules.\\
   /Run this snippets on your terminal:/
#+begin_src
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Likhon-baRoy/.emacs.d.git
cd.emacs.d
#+end_src
4. Ensure a stable connection to Melpa Packages, then open Emacs.
5. Enter =y= when prompted with =Auto-update packages now?=, wait for all packages to install. (Ignore the warnings on the first launch.)
6. In your favorite browser, Ctrl-f Prerequisite through this README and follow the Prerequisite instructions.
7. Restart Emacs and Start using your *Dream Emacs*! :tada:

*☯ Further Updates
I will be updating My-EMACS from time to time, it is best to =git pull= once a while to stay up to date.

Please also execute ~git submodule update --recursive --remote~ to sync with all the submodules.

*☯ Contribution
If you spotted a bug or you have any suggestions, please fill in an issue. If you have something to fix, feel free to create a pull request.

*☯ Special Thanks
Everyone starts somewhere, and I started here.

☯ Prerequisites
*** All the icons
Lets add a package. A good one to start with is *all-the-icons*. This installs a bunch of *icons* and *fonts* - no more blank squares anywhere.

This particular package has a one-time setup step - go ahead and execute now so you never have to worry about it again.

Do the following after opening your Emacs:
1. press =M-x=
2. now type: =all-the-icons-install-fonts=
3. press /<Return>/Enter/ key to install.

You should be good to go!
